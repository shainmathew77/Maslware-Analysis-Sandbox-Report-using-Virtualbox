# 🛡️ Sentinel: Malware Analysis Sandbox (Report & Visualization)

## 📘 Overview

This repository contains the **project report** and **visualization scripts** (`app.py`, `dashboard.py`) for **Sentinel**, a malware analysis sandbox developed using:

- **REMnux Linux** – For static analysis and network-based inspection
- **FLARE VM** (Windows 10) – For dynamic analysis and reverse engineering
- **VirtualBox** – For isolating the analysis environment
- **Python** – For custom visualization of malware behavior

> Note: The full sandbox setup (VMs, tools) is not included. It is a Practical project. All the directions are in the repo and the demo visualization.
